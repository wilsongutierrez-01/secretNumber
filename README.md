# 🎮 Number Guessing Game - Java

A fun guessing game where you try to discover a randomly generated secret number within a specific range.

## 📝 Description

This project is a Java implementation of the classic **"Number Guessing Game"**, where the player must guess a random number generated by the computer within a given range, with a limited number of attempts.

This project is part of the **[Number Guessing Game Challenge](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)** from roadmap.sh, designed to help developers practice their programming skills.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- ✅ Hints after each attempt (higher/lower number)
- ✅ Attempt counter
- ✅ Interactive and friendly messages
- ✅ Basic input validation

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Select a difficulty level:
   - **Easy**: 10 attempts (range 1-50)
   - **Medium**: 5 attempts (range 1-75)
   - **Hard**: 3 attempts (range 1-100)

2. Enter your number when prompted

3. You'll receive hints if the secret number is higher or lower than your guess

4. Win if you guess the number before running out of attempts!

## 🛠️ Code Structure

The program contains these main methods:

- `generateSecretNumber()`: Generates the random number
- `welcome()`: Shows welcome message
- `selectLevel()`: Handles difficulty selection
- `levelSelected()`: Configures game settings based on difficulty
- `guessNumber()`: Processes each player attempt

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed
2. Compile the file: `javac Main.java`
3. Run the program: `java Main`
4. Follow on-screen instructions and have fun!

## 📌 Additional Notes

This project is great for:
- Learning Java basics
- Practicing I/O handling
- Understanding random number generation
- Implementing conditional logic
